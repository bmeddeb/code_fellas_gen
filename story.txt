As I was traveling down the Hauptstrasse, you wouldn't believe what I spotted. 
At my favorite shop, the most beautiful pair of Lederhose I had ever seen. 
But I did not have money with me so I was sad and I just went to the ratskeller to drink my sorrows away.
Making my way back home, I noticed a Hund had begun to follow me.
