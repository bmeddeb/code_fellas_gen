As I was traveling down the Hauptstrasse, you wouldn't believe what I spotted. 
At my favorite shop, the most beautiful pair of Lederhose I had ever seen. 
But I did not have money with me so I was sad and I just went to the ratskeller to drink my sorrows away.
Making my way back home, I noticed a Hund had begun to follow me. 
I ran home and ensured that the Schloss was locked behind me.
I was unsure if the hund would leave me be so I considered getting to the nearest Flughafen.
But just as I was about to leave, the Hund transformed into a talking Döner, who said, "Don't worry, I'm just a shape-shifting Döner with a craving for adventure!"
